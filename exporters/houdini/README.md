# Houdini PBRT Export

Plugins and HDAs for rendering data from Houdini using pbrt.

# Requirements

Currently, because the HDA is a non-commerical asset, and third-party rendering requires a full commercial license or an education license, you can only render with an Education license. If your school/institution does not have access, contact SideFX (education@sidefx.com).

# Installation

Either add  `exporter/houdini` path to `$HOUDINI_PATH`, or copy the folders and contents of the __config__, __soho__, and __otls__ directories to your *$HOME/houdiniXX.YY* folder.

# Usage
